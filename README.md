# Mini-RPG

Mini-RPG is a simple mini RPG game where you can create different heroes to fight against enemies. The game is presented in a 2D click view and offers features like dungeons with enemies, fighting by attacking & defending, getting loot and a hardcore mode. The objective of the game is to fight rounds against enemies and survive with the hero, as well as level him up.


## Features

- **Create heroes:** Create your own hero
- **Fight enemies:** Compete against various enemies and fight in turn-based battles to earn coins and level up your hero.
- **2D Click View:** The game is displayed in a simple 2D click view where you can perform actions.
- **Hardcore Mode & Leveling Up:** Each hero has a certain number of life points that can decrease during battles. If you are not playing in Hardcore mode, the life is regenerated after each enemy. When you kill the enemies, you receive coins so that you can improve your hero.


## Requirements

To run the game, you must meet the following requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured


## Usage

1. Download the [latest version/release](https://github.com/jensbeh/pmws2021-minirpg-jensbeh/releases) of the game.
2. Double-click on the ".jar" file to start the game.


## Gameplay

1. Select a hero and give it a name or load a previous hero.
2. In the dungeon you can attack or defend and try to survive the dungeon.
3. Don't forget to level up your hero.
4. After you have completed the dungeon, you can go straight to the next one to keep playing with your levelled-up hero.


## Hardcore mode

The Hardcore mode offers an additional challenge for battle-hardened players. In this mode, the fights are more difficult because your life does NOT regenerate after each round and so you have to play through the dungeon without regenerating.
